# Outrigger

Easy containerized development environments based on Docker

The various projects within the Outrigger ecosystem provide simple to manage
project environments for any technology and deployment architecture. These
environments are based upon Docker, Outrigger helps you tie the pieces
together to provide a stable foundation for project work that includes:

* A Docker Machine based VM
* [DNS services](common-tasks/dns-resolution.md)
* Network routing
* [High speed filesystems](project-setup/key-concepts.md#project-code)
* [Persistent data storage](project-setup/key-concepts.md#persistent-data-volume)

The Outrigger approach is to configure and use standard Docker tools. This allows
you the option to learn these tools when you want to and provides the
flexibility to override or substitute components should it be necessary for your
project.

If you are brand new to Outrigger and Docker, it is **highly recommended** you read 
the [Glossary](appendix/glossary.md) and [Architecture](appendix/architecture.md) 
documents to get familiar with the concepts and terminology used throughout this 
documentation.
